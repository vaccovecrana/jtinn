# JTinn

`JTinn` is a minimal neural network library.

It is based on [Tinn - The tiny neural network library](https://github.com/glouw/tinn), but
breaks api compatibility, since the upstream project seems to be no longer maintained.

## Supported features

The reference test cases replicate written character recognition from the same
data set as `tinn`.

Add the following dependency from Maven Central to your project:

    implementation "io.vacco.jtinn:jtinn:<VERSION>"
